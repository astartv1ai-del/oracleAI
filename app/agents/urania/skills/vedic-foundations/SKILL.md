# Vedic foundations — Lahiri Kundli

## Trigger

Use for Vedic, Jyotish, Kundli, sidereal, Lahiri, graha, lagna or rashi requests in Russian, English or mixed language.

## Evidence workflow

Call `get_vedic_chart` before stating a planet, Rahu/Ketu, lagna, sign, degree or house. Name the tradition as **Vedic/Jyotish, sidereal Lahiri** and preserve the returned ephemeris and precision metadata. Do not reuse the Western Tropical/Placidus chart as Vedic evidence.

With `precision=date_only`, use only time-independent placements and explicitly omit lagna and houses. With `precision=exact`, houses are whole-sign Vedic houses in the returned contract; do not silently call them Placidus houses.

## Output and safety

Separate **calculated evidence** from **traditional symbolic interpretation**. Offer hypotheses, observable questions and practical reflection. Never present karma, marriage, illness, death, wealth, legal outcomes or another person’s intentions as certainty. Vedic symbolism is not medical, legal, financial or psychological diagnosis.
